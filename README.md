- 👋 Hi, I’m srinivas and work in financial services in Hong Kong.
- 👀 I’m interested in automating tasks and sourcing financial data outside of the traditional sources.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use python since a year ago and use it primarily to reconcile client trades with various brokers/custodians.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ideas that will help asset managers reduce their market data costs, increase efficiency, etc
- 📫  I can be reached on padmasola@gmail.com
