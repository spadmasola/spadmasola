- 👋 Hi, I’m srinivas padmasola and work in financial services in Hong Kong.
- 👀 I’m interested in automating tasks and accessing financial data outside of the traditional sources.
- 🌱 I’m currently using python to reconcile client trades with various brokers/custodians as well as generate MIS reports.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ideas that will help asset managers reduce their market data costs, increase efficiency, generate alpha,   etc
- 📫  I can be reached on padmasola@gmail.com
